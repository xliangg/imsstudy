1. Request Message
REGISTER  A Client use this message to register an address with a SIP server  RFC3261
INVITE    A User or Service use this message to let another user/service participate in a session. The body of this message would include
a description of the session to which the callee is being invited.  RFC3261
ACK       This is used only for INVITE indicating that the client has received a final response to an INVITE request  RFC3261
CANCEL    This is used to cancel a pending request  RFC3261
BYE       A User Agent Client use this message to terminate the call  RFC3261
OPTIONS   This is used to query a server about its capabilities  RFC3261
INFO      This is used for mid session signaling  RFC3261

MESSAGE   Usually used to send Standalone Message (like SMS). RFC 3428
SUBSCRIBE	used to request asynchronous notification of an event or set of events at a later time. RFC 6665
NOTIFY    used to notify a SIP node that an event that has been requested by an earlier SUBSCRIBE method has occurred. RFC 6665
UPDATE    used for a client to update parameters of a session (such as the set of media streams and their codecs). RFC 3311
PRACK     plays the same role as ACK, but this is used for provisional responses. RFC 3262
PUBLISH   used for publication of presence information. RFC 3093

2. Response Message
1xx	Provisional		The request has been received and processing is continuing  RFC3261
2xx	Success			An ACK, to indicate that the action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.  RFC3261
3xx	Redirection		Further action is required to process this request  RFC3261
4xx	Client Error	The request contains bad syntax and cannot be fulfilled at this server  RFC3261
5xx	Server Error	The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request  RFC3261
6xx	Global Failure	The request cannot be fulfilled at any server  RFC3261


1xx:

100 Trying		This response indicates that the request has been received by the next-hop server and that some unspecified action is being
taken on behalf of this call (for example, a database is being consulted).This response, like all other provisional responses, stops 
retransmissions of an INVITE by a UAC.  The 100 (Trying) response is different from other provisional responses, in that it is never 
forwarded upstream by a stateful proxy.

Ref : RFC 3261 21.1.1 100 Trying
 
180 Ringing		The UA receiving the INVITE is trying to alert the user.  This response MAY be used to initiate local ringback

Ref : RFC 3261 21.1.2 180 Ringing

181 Call Is Being Forwarded		A server MAY use this status code to indicate that the call is being forwarded to a different set of 
destinations

Ref : RFC 3261 21.1.3 181 Call Is Being Forwarded

182 Queued		The called party is temporarily unavailable, but the server has decided to queue the call rather than reject it.  When 
the callee becomes available, it will return the appropriate final status response. The reason phrase MAY give further details about 
the status of the call, for example, "5 calls queued; expected waiting time is 15 minutes".  The server MAY issue several 182 (Queued) 
responses to update the caller about the status of the queued call.

Ref : RFC 3261 1.1.4 182 Queued

183 Session Progress			This response is used to convey information about the progress of the call that is not otherwise classified.  
The Reason-Phrase, header fields, or message body MAY be used to convey more details about the call progress.

Ref : RFC 3261 21.1.5 183 Session Progress

2xx:

200 OK			The request has succeeded.  The information returned with the response depends on the method used in the request

Ref : RFC 3261 21.2.1 200 OK

3xx:
300 Multiple Choices			The address in the request resolved to several choices, each with its own specific location, and the user (or 
UA) can select a preferred communication end point and redirect its request to that location.
 
The response MAY include a message body containing a list of resource characteristics and location(s) from which the user or UA can 
choose the one most appropriate, if allowed by the Accept request header field.  However, no MIME types have been defined for this 
message body.
Ref : RFC 3261 21.3.1 300 Multiple Choices

 
301 Moved Permanently			The user can no longer be found at the address in the Request-URI, and the requesting client SHOULD retry at 
the new address given by the Contact header field.  The requestor SHOULD update any local directories, address books, and user location 
caches with this new value and redirect future requests to the address(es) listed.

Ref : RFC 3261 21.3.2 301 Moved Permanently

 
302 Moved Temporarily			The requesting client SHOULD retry the request at the new address(es) given by the Contact header field 
(Section 20.10).  The Request-URI of the new request uses the value of the Contact header field in the response

Ref : RFC 3261 21.3.3 302 Moved Temporarily

 
305 Use Proxy					The requested resource MUST be accessed through the proxy given by the Contact field.  The Contact field gives 
the URI of the proxy.The recipient is expected to repeat this single request via the proxy.  305 (Use Proxy) responses MUST only be 
generate by UASs

Ref : RFC 3261 21.3.4 305 Use Proxy

380 Alternative Service			The call was not successful, but alternative services are possible. The alternative services are described 
in the message body of the response.  Formats for such bodies are not defined here, and may be the subject of future standardization

Ref : RFC 3261 21.3.5 380 Alternative Service

4xx:
400 Bad Request					The request could not be understood due to malformed syntax.  The Reason-Phrase SHOULD identify the syntax 
problem in more detail, for example, "Missing Call-ID header field".

Ref : RFC 3261 21.4.1 400 Bad Request

 
401 Unauthorized				This indicate that Registra wants to go through Authentication Process
(see Registration with Authentication for details)
 
402	Payment Required 
 
403 Forbidden				This indicate that a forbidden request has arrived.
For example, REGISTER message with wrong parameters has arrived. (e.g, the ueid or domain name or realm domain is not the one that 
CSCF is expecting. In this case, CSCF send 403 right after it got REGISTER message).
 
P-CSCF check if the private user identity conveyed in the Authorization header field of the protected REGISTER request is the same as 
the private user identity which was previously challenged or authenticated. If the private user identities are different, the P-CSCF 
shall reject the REGISTER request by returning a 403 response.(TS 24.229)
 
If the P-CSCF detect that the Request-URI of the initial request for a dialog, or a standalone transaction, or an unknown method does 
not match any one of the emergency service identifiers in the associated lists, the P-CSCF shall reject the request by returning a 403 
to UE (TS 24.229)
When the I-CSCF recieves a REGISTER request, the I-CSCF shall verify whether or not it has arrived from a trusted domain. If the request 
has not arrived from a trusted domain, the I-CSCF shall complete the processing of the request by responding with 403(TS 24.229)

 
404 Not Found				The server has definitive information that the user does not exist at the domain specified in the Request-URI.  This 
status is also returned if the domain in the Request-URI does not match any of the domains handled by the recipient of the request.

Ref : RFC 3261 21.4.5 404 Not Found

 
405 Method Not Allowed		The method specified in the Request-Line is understood, but not allowed for the address identified by the 
Request-URI. The response MUST include an Allow header field containing a list of valid methods for the indicated address.

Ref : RFC 3261 21.4.6 405 Method Not Allowed

 
406 Not Acceptable			The resource identified by the request is only capable of generating response entities that have content 
characteristics not acceptable according to the Accept header field sent in the request.

Ref : RFC 3261 21.4.7 406 Not Acceptable

 
407 Proxy Authentication Required
 
 
408 Request Timeout			The server could not produce a response within a suitable amount of time, for example, if it could not determine 
the location of the user in time.  The client MAY repeat the request without modifications at any later time.

Ref : RFC 3261 21.4.9 408 Request Timeout

414 Request-URI Too Long
 
 
415 Unsupported Media Type
 
 
416 Unsupported URI Scheme
 
 
420 Bad Extension
 
 
421 Extension Required
 
 
423 Interval Too Brief		This error indicates that the same messages was received multiple times with two short interval. (E.g, An UA 
send SIP:REGISTER message twice with very short interval and the Registra would send 423)
The server is rejecting the request because the expiration time of the resource refreshed by the request is too short.  This response 
can be used by a registrar to reject a registration whose Contact header field expiration time was too small.

You may reduce the chance of this error by tweaking Min-Expires header

5xx:
500 Server Internal Error	The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.  The client MAY 
display the specific error condition and MAY retry the request after several seconds. If the condition is temporary, the server MAY 
indicate when the client may retry the request using the Retry-After header field.

If Retry-After is set to be specific value, UE should retry after the specified time and if Retry-After is not set, UE is expected to 
retry in around 30 sec at the first retry and with extended back-off time.
